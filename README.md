# Sales-Prediction
This project involves building a predictive model to estimate sales based on historical data. Using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, we clean the dataset, explore key insights through visualization, and apply regression techniques to forecast sales.

 # Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (no missing values)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Feature selection and encoding
Model training and evaluation using machine learning
Performance metrics to assess prediction accuracy


 # Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
